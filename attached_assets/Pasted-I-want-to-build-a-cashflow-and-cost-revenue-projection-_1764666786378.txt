I want to build a cashflow and cost–revenue projection web dashboard based on an Excel file named "Hemitech RAB.xlsx".

Tech stack:
- React + TypeScript (Vite or CRA, up to you)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- A chart library (Recharts or Chart.js)
- Use functional components and hooks

Excel structure (sheets and key columns):

1) Sheet "SUMMARY"
- Contains aggregated numbers:
  - Cost / Resource / OPEX / CAPEX
  - Total Cost (C5)
  - Total Income (C7)
  - Revenue (C9)
Use these values to generate:
- KPI cards:
  - Total Cost
  - Total Income
  - Net Profit (Total Income – Total Cost)
  - Revenue
- Also show a simple bar chart comparing:
  - Resource
  - OPEX
  - CAPEX
  - Total Cost
  - Total Income

2) Sheet "CAPEX (Setup Awal)"
Columns:
- Kategori (A)
- Item (B)
- Description (C)
- Qty (D)
- Harga Satuan (Rp) (E)
- Total (Rp) (F)
Use this to:
- Show a CAPEX table with sorting and simple search
- Show a bar chart total CAPEX per Kategori (sum of F per Kategori)
- Show total CAPEX value at the bottom

3) Sheet "OPEX (Bulanan & Tahunan)"
Columns:
- Kategori (A)
- Item (B)
- Total Bulanan (Rp) (C)
- Total Tahunan (Rp) (D)
Use this to:
- Show an OPEX table
- Show two summary numbers:
  - Total OPEX Bulanan (sum of C)
  - Total OPEX Tahunan (sum of D)
- Show a bar chart of Total Tahunan per Kategori

4) Sheet "Pegawai"
Columns:
- Kategori / Level (A)
- Role (B)
- Qty (D)
- Salary/month (E)
- Total Salary/month (F)
- Total Salary/year (G)
- THR / Benefit (H)
Use this to:
- Show staff cost breakdown (table)
- Show number of employees (sum of Qty)
- Show total salary cost per year (sum of G)
- Optional: bar chart of Total Salary/year per Role

5) Sheet "Revenue"
Important rows/columns:
- Target, Subscription, Grand Total / Year
- Income/month (row with label "Income/month")
- Income/year (row with label "Income/year")
Use this to:
- Show total Revenue per month and per year
- Show a stacked bar or simple bar chart for each revenue stream (e.g. Payment Gateway Fees, Subscription, etc.)

Data handling:
- For now, create TypeScript interfaces that represent each logical entity:
  - Summary, CapexItem, OpexItem, Employee, RevenueSummary
- Mock the data in a separate file (e.g. src/data/mockHemitechRab.ts) based on the sample structure above.
- Put all calculations (totals and aggregations) in reusable utility functions (e.g. src/utils/finance.ts).

Cashflow & projection:
- Build a "Cashflow Projection" section that:
  - Takes:
    - Base yearly revenue (from Revenue sheet)
    - Base yearly cost (OPEX + salaries + CAPEX amortization if needed)
  - Has user inputs for:
    - Revenue growth per year (%)
    - Cost growth per year (%)
    - Projection period (e.g. 5 years)
  - Calculates:
    - Revenue per year
    - Cost per year
    - Net cashflow per year (revenue – cost)
    - Cumulative cash position over the projection period
  - Displays this as:
    - A line chart for Revenue vs Cost vs Net Cashflow
    - A second line or area chart for Cumulative Cash Position

Excel integration (frontend only):
- Add a simple upload component that accepts an .xlsx file.
- Use the "xlsx" (SheetJS) library in the browser to parse:
  - "SUMMARY"
  - "CAPEX (Setup Awal)"
  - "OPEX (Bulanan & Tahunan)"
  - "Pegawai"
  - "Revenue"
- Map the parsed rows into the same TypeScript interfaces used by the mock data.
- When a file is uploaded successfully, replace the mock data with data from the uploaded Excel.

UI/UX requirements:
- Create a main layout with:
  - Header: project name "Hemitech Cashflow Dashboard"
  - Left sidebar or top navigation with sections:
    - Overview
    - CAPEX
    - OPEX
    - Pegawai
    - Revenue
    - Cashflow Projection
  - Main content area that switches between sections.
- Use responsive design (works on desktop and tablet).
- Use Tailwind utility classes to:
  - Show KPI cards in a grid.
  - Show tables with sticky headers and scrolling.
  - Add small hover effects on cards and chart containers.

Deliverables:
- A complete React + TypeScript project structure with:
  - Components: SummaryCards, CapexSection, OpexSection, EmployeesSection, RevenueSection, CashflowProjectionSection, Layout, FileUpload
  - Data and types: src/data/mockHemitechRab.ts, src/types/*
  - Utils: src/utils/finance.ts for calculations
- Example charts using the mocked data.
- Clear TODO comments indicating where I should plug in the real Excel parsing logic or API later.

Please generate all necessary files, React components, and utility functions to make this dashboard compile and run as a working example.
